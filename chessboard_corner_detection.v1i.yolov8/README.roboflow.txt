The dataset includes 279 images.
Corner are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random exposure adjustment of between -27 and +27 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.75 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 3 percent of pixels

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically
